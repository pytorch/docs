# ConvAddReLU2d

*class*torch.ao.nn.intrinsic.modules.fused.ConvAddReLU2d(*conv*, *add*, *relu*)[[source]](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/a471a58d241b08025dcb4ec69c2d30e5a49a757a/torch/ao/nn/intrinsic/modules/fused.py#L308)

This is a sequential container which calls the Conv2d, add, Relu.
During quantization this will be replaced with the corresponding fused module.

Applies convolution to x1, adds the result to x2, and applies ReLU.
