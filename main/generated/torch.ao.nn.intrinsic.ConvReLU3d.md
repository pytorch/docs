# ConvReLU3d

*class*torch.ao.nn.intrinsic.ConvReLU3d(*conv*, *relu*)[[source]](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/09c9b1ec9c2e88520d11a9c64b206359e8ca912b/torch/ao/nn/intrinsic/modules/fused.py#L76)

This is a sequential container which calls the Conv3d and ReLU modules.
During quantization this will be replaced with the corresponding fused module.
