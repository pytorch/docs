torch.fx.passes.utils.source_matcher_utils.check_subgraphs_connected(*subgraph1*, *subgraph2*)[[source]](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/784e50bb03d4ff5f8fdc368da8449558a8fb4a43/torch/fx/passes/utils/source_matcher_utils.py#L177)

Given two subgraphs A and B (in the form of a list of nodes), checks if
A has nodes connecting to at least one node in B - aka there exists a node
in B that uses a node in A (not the other way around).
