# torch._foreach_reciprocal

torch._foreach_reciprocal(*self: [tuple](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple)[[Tensor](../tensors.html#torch.Tensor), ...] | [list](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list)[[Tensor](../tensors.html#torch.Tensor)]*) → [tuple](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple)[[Tensor](../tensors.html#torch.Tensor), ...]

Applies [`torch.reciprocal()`](torch.reciprocal.html#torch.reciprocal) to each tensor in `self` and returns the
results as a tuple.
