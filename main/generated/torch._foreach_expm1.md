# torch._foreach_expm1

torch._foreach_expm1(*self: [tuple](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple)[[Tensor](../tensors.html#torch.Tensor), ...] | [list](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list)[[Tensor](../tensors.html#torch.Tensor)]*) → [tuple](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple)[[Tensor](../tensors.html#torch.Tensor), ...]

Applies [`torch.expm1()`](torch.expm1.html#torch.expm1) to each tensor in `self` and returns the
results as a tuple.
