torch.xpu.init()[[source]](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/b43489ea06ed9a3bb80dbbd18300f8b0ef6f56a1/torch/xpu/__init__.py#L360)

Initialize PyTorch's XPU state.
This is a Python API about lazy initialization that avoids initializing
XPU until the first time it is accessed. Does nothing if the XPU state is
already initialized.
