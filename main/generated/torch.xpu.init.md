torch.xpu.init()[[source]](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/9aee436a1bfc7a0bd2c40f48f128cb185ee3d75e/torch/xpu/__init__.py#L360)

Initialize PyTorch's XPU state.
This is a Python API about lazy initialization that avoids initializing
XPU until the first time it is accessed. Does nothing if the XPU state is
already initialized.
