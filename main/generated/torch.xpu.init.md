torch.xpu.init()[[source]](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/b58511bf7d1e77b23d16cb44e2eacf0f2e05be9c/torch/xpu/__init__.py#L334)

Initialize PyTorch's XPU state.
This is a Python API about lazy initialization that avoids initializing
XPU until the first time it is accessed. Does nothing if the XPU state is
already initialized.
