torch.xpu.init()[[source]](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/b14e6fb508b03fc0a98fefe9b0750ba0d63500da/torch/xpu/__init__.py#L327)

Initialize PyTorch's XPU state.
This is a Python API about lazy initialization that avoids initializing
XPU until the first time it is accessed. Does nothing if the XPU state is
already initialized.
