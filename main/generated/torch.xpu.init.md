torch.xpu.init()[[source]](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/c7cc4bfa9ed99a2c007afe3e21208bc892c5aa18/torch/xpu/__init__.py#L317)

Initialize PyTorch's XPU state.
This is a Python API about lazy initialization that avoids initializing
XPU until the first time it is accessed. Does nothing if the XPU state is
already initialized.
