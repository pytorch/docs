torch.xpu.init()[[source]](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/df83f06a8c49a667b9408934fa9eaae1aaf32d04/torch/xpu/__init__.py#L327)

Initialize PyTorch's XPU state.
This is a Python API about lazy initialization that avoids initializing
XPU until the first time it is accessed. Does nothing if the XPU state is
already initialized.
