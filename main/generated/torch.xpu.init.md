torch.xpu.init()[[source]](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/b5cf35aa75e0d5087ede9131ab2f970aa2de6509/torch/xpu/__init__.py#L369)

Initialize PyTorch's XPU state.
This is a Python API about lazy initialization that avoids initializing
XPU until the first time it is accessed. Does nothing if the XPU state is
already initialized.
