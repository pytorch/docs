torch.xpu.init()[[source]](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/27b52de22e4e5fa572c07a4065423083a41b8756/torch/xpu/__init__.py#L333)

Initialize PyTorch's XPU state.
This is a Python API about lazy initialization that avoids initializing
XPU until the first time it is accessed. Does nothing if the XPU state is
already initialized.
