torch.xpu.init()[[source]](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/8fcaa153fa223ca9f7844513d86d4d30a0cf2533/torch/xpu/__init__.py#L360)

Initialize PyTorch's XPU state.
This is a Python API about lazy initialization that avoids initializing
XPU until the first time it is accessed. Does nothing if the XPU state is
already initialized.
