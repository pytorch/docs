*class*torch.ao.nn.intrinsic.LinearReLU(*linear*, *relu*)[[source]](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/25af31d252bc789059a6c3b5511977f4fa7d1d4e/torch/ao/nn/intrinsic/modules/fused.py#L93)

This is a sequential container which calls the Linear and ReLU modules.
During quantization this will be replaced with the corresponding fused module.
