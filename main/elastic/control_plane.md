# Control Plane

This module contains optional helpers that add extra debug and control handlers
into your application.

torch.distributed.elastic.control_plane.worker_main()[[source]](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/5abd8608770f0b56abd2b52412c9b39feeb6153e/torch/distributed/elastic/control_plane.py#L26)

This is a context manager that wraps your main entry function. This combines
the existing `errors.record` logic as well as a new `_WorkerServer` that
exposes handlers via a unix socket specified by
`TORCH_WORKER_SERVER_SOCKET`.

Example

```
@worker_main()
def main():
 pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
 main()
```
