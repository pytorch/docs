Pipeline Parallelism
####################

.. note::
  ``torch.distributed.pipelining`` is currently in alpha state and under
  development. API changes may be possible. It was migrated from the `PiPPy
  <https://github.com/pytorch/PiPPy>`_ project.


Why Pipeline Parallel?
**********************

Pipeline Parallelism is one of the **primitive** parallelism for deep learning.
It allows the **execution** of a model to be partitioned such that multiple
**micro-batches** can execute different parts of the model code concurrently.
Pipeline parallelism can be an effective technique for:

* large-scale training
* bandwidth-limited clusters
* large model inference.

The above scenarios share a commonality that the computation per device cannot
hide the communication of conventional parallelism, for example, the weight
all-gather of FSDP.


What is ``torch.distributed.pipelining``?
*****************************************

While promising for scaling, pipelining is often difficult to implement because
it needs to **partition the execution** of a model in addition to model weights.
The partitioning of execution often requires intrusive code changes to your
model. Another aspect of complexity comes from **scheduling micro-batches in a
distributed environment**, with **data flow dependency** considered.

The ``pipelining`` package provides a toolkit that does said things
**automatically** which allows easy implementation of pipeline parallelism
on **general** models.

It consists of two parts: a
**splitting frontend** and a **distributed runtime**.
The splitting frontend takes your model code as-is, splits it up into "model
partitions", and capture the data-flow relationship.  The distributed runtime
executes the pipeline stages on different devices in parallel, handling things
like micro-batch splitting, scheduling, communication, and gradient propagation,
etc.

Overall, the ``pipelining`` package provides the following features:

* Splitting of model code based on simple specification. The goal is to make
  parallelism work for your model with **zero model code change**.
* Rich support for pipeline schedules, including GPipe, 1F1B,
  Interleaved 1F1B and Looped BFS, and providing the infrastruture for writing
  customized schedules.
* First-class support for cross-host pipeline parallelism, as this is where PP
  is typically used (over slower interconnects).
* Composability with other PyTorch parallel techniques such as data parallel
  (DDP, FSDP) or tensor  parallel. The `TorchTitan
  <https://github.com/pytorch/torchtitan>`_ project demonstrates a "3D parallel"
  application on the Llama model.


Step 1: choose the frontend that fits your need
***********************************************

The ``pipelining`` package provides two frontends for two different use cases.
You can make your choice based on whether you have:

* a full model, or
* module constructor for each stage.


Frontend 1: the ``pipeline`` API -- if you have a full model
============================================================

If you have a full model and do not want to spend time on modifying it into a
sequence of "model partitions", the ``pipeline`` API is here to help.
Here is a brief example:

.. code-block:: python

  class Model(torch.nn.Module):
      def __init__(self) -> None:
          super().__init__()
          self.emb = torch.nn.Embedding(10, 3)
          self.layers = torch.nn.ModuleList(
              Layer() for _ in range(2)
          )
          self.lm = LMHead()

      def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
          x = self.emb(x)
          for layer in self.layers:
              x = layer(x)
          x = self.lm(x)
          return x


If we print the model, we can see multiple hierarchies, which makes it hard to split by hand::

  Model(
    (emb): Embedding(10, 3)
    (layers): ModuleList(
      (0-1): 2 x Layer(
        (lin): Linear(in_features=3, out_features=3, bias=True)
      )
    )
    (lm): LMHead(
      (proj): Linear(in_features=3, out_features=3, bias=True)
    )
  )

Let us see how the ``pipeline`` API works:

.. code-block:: python

  from torch.distributed.pipelining import pipeline, SplitPoint

  x = torch.LongTensor([1, 2, 4, 5])
  pipe = pipeline(
      module=mod,
      num_chunks=1,
      example_args=(x,),
      split_spec={
          "layers.1": SplitPoint.BEGINNING,
      }
  )

The ``pipeline`` API splits your model given a ``split_spec``, where
``SplitPoint.BEGINNING`` stands for adding a split point
*before* execution of certain submodule in the ``forward`` function, and
similarly, ``SplitPoint.END`` for split point *after* such.

If we ``print(pipe)``, we can see::

  GraphModule(
    (submod_0): GraphModule(
      (emb): InterpreterModule()
      (layers): Module(
        (0): InterpreterModule(
          (lin): InterpreterModule()
        )
      )
    )
    (submod_1): GraphModule(
      (layers): Module(
        (1): InterpreterModule(
          (lin): InterpreterModule()
        )
      )
      (lm): InterpreterModule(
        (proj): InterpreterModule()
      )
    )
  )

  def forward(self, x):
      submod_0 = self.submod_0(x);  x = None
      submod_1 = self.submod_1(submod_0);  submod_0 = None
      return (submod_1,)


The "model partitions" are represented by submodules (``submod_0``,
``submod_1``), each of which is reconstructed with original model operations
and hierarchies.  In addition, a "root-level" ``forward`` function is
reconstructed to capture the data flow between those partitions. Such data flow
will be replayed by the pipeline runtime later, in a distributed fashion.

The ``Pipe`` object provides a method for retrieving the "model partitions":

.. code-block:: python

  stage_mod : nn.Module = pipe.get_stage_module(stage_idx)

You can also create a distributed stage runtime on a device using ``Pipe``:

.. code-block:: python

  from torch.distributed.pipelining import TracerPipelineStage
  stage = TracerPipelineStage(pipe, stage_idx, device)

.. note::
  The ``pipeline`` frontend uses a tracer (``torch.export``) to capture your
  model into a single graph. If your model is not full-graph'able, you can use
  our manual frontend below.

Frontend 2: ``PipelineStage`` -- if you already have module for each stage
================================================================================

If you already have the module for each stage, you can skip the pipeline split
step above and directly connect to our runtime offering: ``PipelineStage``.
The ``PipelineStage`` wraps your stage module given a distributed context,
i.e. a ``ProcessGroup`` along the pipeline dimension.

.. code-block:: python

  from torch.distributed.pipelining import PipelineStage
  stage = PipelineStage(
      stage_mod,
      stage_idx,
      num_stages,
      device,
      input_args=x.chunk(num_microbatches)[0],
  )

The ``PipelineStage`` requires an example argument (similar to ``example_args`` used in ``pipeline``).
This argument is passed through the forward method of the stage module to determine the
input and output shapes required for communication.


Step 2: use ``PipelineSchedule`` for execution
**********************************************

We can now attach the ``PipelineStage`` to a pipeline schedule, and run the
schedule with input data. Here is a GPipe example:

.. code-block:: python

  from torch.distributed.pipelining import ScheduleGPipe

  # Create a schedule
  schedule = ScheduleGPipe(stage, n_microbatches)

  # Input data (whole batch)
  x = torch.randn(batch_size, in_dim, device=device)

  # Run the pipeline with input `x`
  # `x` will be divided into microbatches automatically
  if rank == 0:
      schedule.step(x)
  else:
      output = schedule.step()

Note that the above code needs to be launched for each worker, thus we use a
launcher service to launch multiple processes:

.. code-block:: bash

  torchrun --nproc_per_node=2 example.py


Hugging Face Examples
*********************

In the `PiPPy <https://github.com/pytorch/PiPPy>`_ repo where this package was
original created, we kept examples based on unmodified Hugging Face models.
See the `examples/huggingface
<https://github.com/pytorch/PiPPy/tree/main/examples/huggingface>`_ directory.

Examples include:

* `GPT2 <https://github.com/pytorch/PiPPy/tree/main/examples/huggingface/pippy_gpt2.py>`_
* `Llama <https://github.com/pytorch/PiPPy/tree/main/examples/llama>`_


Technical Deep Dive
*******************

How does the ``pipeline`` API split a model?
============================================

First, the ``pipeline`` API turns our model into a directed acyclic graph (DAG)
by tracing the model.  It traces the model using ``torch.export`` -- a PyTorch 2
full-graph capturing tool.

Then, it groups together the **operations and parameters** needed by a stage
into a reconstructed submodule: ``submod_0``, ``submod_1``, ...

Different from conventional submodule access methods like ``Module.children()``,
the ``pipeline`` API does not only cut the module structure of your model, but
also the **forward** function of your model.

This is necessary because model structure like ``Module.children()`` merely
captures information during ``Module.__init__()``, and does not capture any
information about ``Module.forward()``. Said differently, ``Module.children()``
lacks information about the following aspects key to pipelininig:

* Execution order of child modules in ``forward``
* Activation flows between child modules
* Whether there are any functional operators between child modules (for example,
  ``relu`` or ``add`` operations will not be captured by ``Module.children()``).

The ``pipeline`` API, on the contrary, makes sure that the ``forward`` behavior
is truly preserved. It also captures the activation flow between the partitions,
helping the distributed runtime to make correct send/receive calls without human
intervention.

Another flexibility of the ``pipeline`` API is that split points can be at
arbitrary levels within your model hierarchy. In the split partitions, the original model
hierarchy related to that partition will be reconstructed at no cost to you.
At a result, fully-qualified names (FQNs) pointing to a submodule or parameter
would be still valid, and services that relies on FQNs (such as FSDP, TP or
checkpointing) can still run with your partitioned modules with almost zero code
change.


Implementing Your Own Schedule
******************************

You can implement your own pipeline schedule by extending one of the following two class:

* ``PipelineScheduleSingle``
* ``PipelineScheduleMulti``

``PipelineScheduleSingle`` is for schedules that assigns *only one* stage per rank.
``PipelineScheduleMulti`` is for schedules that assigns multiple stages per rank.

For example, ``ScheduleGPipe`` and ``Schedule1F1B`` are subclasses of ``PipelineScheduleSingle``.
Whereas, ``ScheduleInterleaved1F1B`` and ``ScheduleLoopedBFS`` are subclasses of ``PipelineScheduleMulti``.
